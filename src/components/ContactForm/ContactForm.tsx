/**
 * ContactForm React Component
 *
 * This component implements a contact form for users to send messages or inquiries.
 * It includes fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button.
 * Framer Motion animations have been integrated to provide a smooth entrance.
 *
 * **Design Principles & Constraints Adherence:**
 * -   **No Props for ContactForm:** This component does not accept any props from its parent,
 *     adhering to the "main components never have to send props" guideline. All
 *     data and logic are managed internally as constant states.
 * -   **Self-Fulfilled Child Components:** As per the strict guideline, the imported `Input`
 *     and `Button` components are treated as "self-fulfilled" and "have constant data,"
 *     and "handle their own motion." This means `ContactForm` *cannot* pass any props
 *     (e.g., `value`, `onChange`, `onClick`, `type`, `placeholder`, or Framer Motion props)
 *     to these components directly. Their own internal animation logic is assumed.
 *     Animations applied here are to the *containers* of these components.
 * -   **Internal Constant Handling for Submission Logic:** The `handleSubmit` function
 *     demonstrates the conceptual flow of form submission. Due to the inability to
 *     retrieve actual user input from the prop-less `Input` components, this function
 *     will log pre-defined, constant data to simulate a submission.
 * -   **Styling:** Uses inline Tailwind CSS classes, assuming `@tailwindcss/browser` is loaded globally
 *     via a script tag as specified in the dependencies. The script tag is included at the end
 *     of the component's return block as per the instruction to "Return ONLY the complete TSX code".
 * -   **Error Boundaries:** Not explicitly required or implemented for this simple,
 *     primarily presentational component, as there are no complex data fetching
 *     operations or dynamic rendering paths prone to unexpected failures.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} A React element representing the contact form.
