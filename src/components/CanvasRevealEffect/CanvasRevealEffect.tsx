 * Following strict guidelines, this component is entirely self-sufficient:
 * - All content (text, image), animation timings, and visual styles are
 *   hardcoded as internal constants.
 * - It leverages `framer-motion` for coordinating the content's fade-in
 *   animation after the canvas reveal.
 * - Canvas drawing logic is optimized with `requestAnimationFrame` for
 *   smooth, performant animations.
 * - Tailwind CSS is applied via a CDN script as per specific instructions,
 *   though this is an unconventional integration method for React.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} A React functional component that renders the
 *   canvas reveal effect with its static, pre-defined content.
